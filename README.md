## Overview

This project implements a density-based traffic light controller using an Arduino microcontroller. The system adjusts the traffic light timings based on the traffic density at an intersection. It aims to reduce traffic congestion and optimize traffic flow.

## Features

- Traffic light control based on real-time traffic density.
- Adaptive traffic light timings.
- LED indicators for system status.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller.
- Red, yellow, and green LED lights.
- Jumper wires.
- Breadboard or custom PCB.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `traffic_light_controller.ino` sketch from the project folder.

3. Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable and select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.

4. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.

5. Connect the Arduino and LED lights to the Arduino following the circuit diagram in the `schematic.png` file.

6. Power on the Arduino.

## Usage

1. The system will adapt traffic light timings based on real-time traffic density.

2. In emergency situations, activate the emergency vehicle priority mode to give priority to emergency vehicles.

3. Monitor the LED indicators for system status and feedback.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, double-check the wiring connections and ensure that the sensors are functioning correctly.

- Refer to the Arduino IDE's serial monitor for debugging information.

## Future Improvements

- Implement wireless communication for remote monitoring and control.
- Use machine learning for more advanced traffic prediction and control.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the need for efficient traffic management in urban areas.
- Thanks to the Arduino community for their support and open-source contributions.
